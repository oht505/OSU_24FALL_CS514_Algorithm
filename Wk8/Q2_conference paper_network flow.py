# Suppose you are running a conference and want to assign 40 papers to 12 reviewers.
# Each reviewer bids for 20 papers. You want each paper to be reviewed by 3 reviewers.
# Formulate this problem as a max-flow problem,
# i.e., describe the architecture of the network and the capacities of the edges.
# Assume a reviewer cannot review more than 11 papers.
# What is the maximum flow you can expect in your network?
